## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- You need to have installed Node.js and npm.
- [Here](https://nodejs.org/en) you can download and install both of them.
- I recomend you to download the "Recomended for Most Users" version.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GalisGalisteo/bubbo-books-front-end
```

2. Install dependencies:
   
```bash
cd bubbo-books
npm install
```

### Usage

In order to use the app you need an Android or iOS simulator.
For Android you can use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), and for iOS you can use [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for Mac users or [Appetize.io](https://appetize.io/) for Windows users.

When you already install all the dependencies, you should run the next command:

```bash
npm start
```

[Here](LIKK) you can find a video explaining the app's functionality.
